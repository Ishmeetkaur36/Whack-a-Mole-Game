# Whack-a-Mole-Game

Whack-a-Mole is a simple, interactive game built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic. 

=> Players must "whack" or click on moles that randomly pop up from holes on the game board within a set time limit. 

=> Each successful hit increases the player's score.

 The game involves dynamic elements like random mole appearance and a timer to add challenge and excitement. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations using JavaScript and CSS
